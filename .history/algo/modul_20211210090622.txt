12 Things You Didn't Know about Canada
Who says Canada is boring? From a restaurant that serves a toe cocktail to a Prime Minister who consulted a crystal ball, Canada can be a fascinating place. Here are 12 amazing things you probably didn't know about being Canadian. 
12 캐나다에 대해 몰랐던 사실 누가 캐나다가 지루하다고 합니까?
빌가락 칵테일을 제공하는 레스토랑부터 크리스털 볼로 상담한 국무총리까지, 
캐나다는 매혹적인 장소가 될 수 있다. 여기 여러분이 캐나다인이 되는 것에 대해 아마 몰랐을 12가지 놀라운 점이 있습니다.


1. Our Parliament has a sanctuary for stray cats
Originally cats were used in the Parliament buildings to control mice. A colony of strays has lived just behind the Parliament buildings since the '70s. Fed and cared for by volunteers, today's residents live in little wooden houses and have their own blog and Facebook page. 
1. 우리 국회에는 길고양이를 위한 보호소가 있다.
원래 고양이는 국회의사당 건물에서 쥐를 통제하기 위해 사용되었다.
70년대부터 국회의사당 건물 바로 뒤에 길 잃은 사람들이 살고 있다.
자원봉사자들의 보살핌을 받으며, 오늘날 주민들은 작은 목조 주택에 살고 있으며, 그들만의 블로그와 페이스북 페이지를 가지고 있다.



2. One of our prime ministers used a crystal ball
William Lyon Mackenzie King (he's the one on Canada's $50 bill) also tried to get advice from his dead mother at séances he held in his home. You can still see his crystal ball in the library of Laurier House in Ottawa — now a National Historic Site. 
우리 수상 중 한 명이 크리스털 볼을 사용해서
 윌리엄 라이언 매켄지 킹(그는 캐나다 50달러 지폐에 있는 사람이다) 또한 그의 집에서 열린 세리앙스에서 돌아가신 어머니로부터 조언을 구하려고 했다. 여러분은 여전히 오타와에 있는 로리에 하우스 도서관에서 그의 수정구를 볼 수 있습니다 - 현재 국립 유적지입니다.



3. We launched a secret project to build an aircraft carrier made from ice
Patricia Lake, just 10 minutes outside of Jasper Alta., was the site of 'Operation Habbakuk,' a bizarre top-secret WWII military experiment. The 1943 mission was to build a 1-to-50-scale prototype of an aircraft carrier using ice and sawdust. The site is now marked by a roadside plaque and submerged monument. 
재스퍼 알타에서 불과 10분 거리에 있는 Patricia Lake는 2차 세계 대전의 기이한 일급 기밀 군사 실험인 'Operation Habbakuk'의 현장이었다. 1943년 임무는 얼음과 톱밥을 이용한 1~50 규모의 항공모함 시제품을 만드는 것이었다. 그 장소는 현재 길가의 명판과 수몰 기념물로 표시되어 있다.
3.우리는 얼음으로 만든 항공모함을 만드는 비밀 프로젝트를 시작했다.

4.  Our beavers built a dam visible from outer space
First discovered by an environmental researcher using Google Earth in 2007, the dam is located just inside Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, the second largest protected area in the world. The dam stretches 2,790 feet (850 metres). 
4. 우리 비버는 우주에서 보이는 댐을 만들었다.
2007년 구글어스를 이용해 환경연구원에 의해 처음 발견된 이 댐은 세계에서 두 번째로 큰 보호구역인 앨버타주 우드버팔로 국립공원 바로 안에 위치해 있다. 그 댐은 850미터(2,790피트)에 걸쳐 있다.




5.  Our cities have some of the freshest  air in the world
When the World Health Organization studied air quality between 2003 and 2010, in 1,100 cities in 91 countries, they ranked Whitehorse, Yukon, as having the freshest. Also in the top 10: British Columbia's Nanaimo, Terrace, Nelson, Kitimat and Burns Lake, plus Corner Brook, N.L., and Fredericton, N.B. 

5. 우리 도시는 세계에서 가장 신선한 공기를 가지고 있다.
세계보건기구가 2003년부터 2010년까지 91개국 1,100개 도시에서 대기질을 연구했을 때, 그들은 유콘 주의 화이트호스를 가장 신선하다고 평가했다. 또한 브리티시 컬럼비아의 나나이모, 테라스, 넬슨, 키티매트, 번스 레이크, 그리고 노스캐롤라이나 주의 코너 브룩과 노스캐롤라이나 주의 프레데릭턴이 10위 안에 들었다.




6.  Have a taste of home when you travel
Order a sandwich with Dijon mustard in France or a dressed hot dog in a U.S. ballpark and smile with some national pride: the mustard was likely made with seeds from our Prairies. Canada is the world's largest exporter of mustard seed — 80 per cent is grown in brilliant yellow fields in Saskatchewan. 
6. 여행 가서 집맛을 보세요.
프랑스의 디종 머스타드와 함께 샌드위치를 주문하거나 미국 야구장에서 옷을 입은 핫도그를 주문하고 국가적 자부심을 느끼며 웃으세요: 머스타드는 아마도 우리 대초원의 씨앗으로 만들어졌을 것입니다. 캐나다는 세계에서 가장 큰 겨자씨 수출국입니다. 80%가 서스캐처원의 찬란한 노란 들판에서 재배됩니다.





7.  Iceberg vodka? How about iceberg wine?
One of the best places in the world to view icebergs is in the village of Twillingate, N.L. A winery in this community uses iceberg water to make wines: Black Currant Iceberg, Bakeapple Iceberg, etc.For fun you can track icebergs by satellite at Icebergfinder.com

9. You can drink a Toe Cocktail in Dawson City, Yukon
It's true! If you make up to the land of the midnight sun, drop by the Sourdough Saloon at the Downtown Hotel and for $5 you can try the Sour Toe Cocktail yourself. This bizarre ritual began in 1973 with a miner's toe that had been amputated in the 1920s. 
9. 유콘 도슨시에서 토 칵테일을 마실 수 있다.

Promoting Employee Happiness Benefits Everyone
Employee happiness has increasingly become an imperative in business. Why? There is now growing evidence that when one's employees are happy, organizations thrive.
To put this claim into perspective, consider just a few key statistics.

직원 행복은 사업에서 점점 더 필수 요소가 되었다.왜일까요? 직원들이 행복할 때, 조직들이 번창한다는 증거가 늘어나고 있습니다.
이 주장을 쉽게 이해하려면 몇 가지 주요 통계만 고려하십시오.

One study found that happy employees are up to 20% more productive than unhappy employees. When it comes to salespeople, happiness has an even greater impact, raising sales by 37%. But the benefits don't end there. 




Happy employees are also good news for organizations: The stock prices of Fortune’s “100 Best Companies to Work for" rose 14% per year from 1998 to 2005, while companies not on the list only reported a 6% increase. 



Defining Happiness In The Workplace 
So, happiness is linked to productivity. But what does it mean to be “happy” in the workplace? 
In his book, The Truth About Employee Engagement, Patrick Lencioni boils it down to wanting to feel like who you are matters (you want people to know your name), that what you do has an impact (that you're engaged in relevant work) and you're making progress (that your work is having an impact and leading you and your organization forward).








This should be easy, but all too often, employees don't feel valued at all. Why not?   


Too many companies are overly focused on what they do but overlooking and minimizing who is doing the work, as well as how and why they are doing the work. While job security and financial stability are important to job satisfaction, so are opportunities to use one's skills and abilities. The bottom line is that people need to continue to grow in order to remain engaged and productive. 





Promoting Workplace Happiness 
My personal mantra for over a decade has been that I want to do work that I love, from places I love and with people I enjoy. I would argue that most people want this. The challenge is knowing what this means and how to pursue these opportunities. While I have been ruthless in my pursuit of this type of work, I have fallen flat on my face many times.   






Life gets busy and demands at work continue to mount. We all get stuck at times — in habits, routines and relationships that don’t serve us well and even limit our happiness. All too often, we are unaware that this is happening because we don’t have the bandwidth to focus on what is and isn’t making us happy. Even when we are clear about what makes us happy; many of us don't know how to find the bandwidth to bring about change.

Canadian 'Black Friday' fights to keep shoppers from border crossing

Retailers aiming for record day on annual U.S. Thanksgiving merchandise sales event

Forced to compete with the lure of even more duty-free exemptions this shopping season, more Canadian retailers are expected to jump on the U.S.-style Black Friday bandwagon in an effort to keep price-conscious shoppers from crossing the border. 





 
While still not reaching the frenzied heights seen in the U.S., the Canadianized version of Black Friday —the annual U.S. Thanksgiving merchandise sales event — has steadily caught on in Canada over the past few years and is expected to have its biggest year yet. 




"I think you'll see, across the board, all the major players participating this year in the Black Friday frenzy," said Ran Ravitz, general manager of RedFlagDeals.com, which keeps track of consumer deals."Overall, [we're] going to see more participation with smaller chains and chains that didn’t have it last year." 




A number of the big retail chains ramped up their promotions weeks ahead of the annual event, boasting an array of four-day special sales to coincide with the U.S. long weekend. Most of the big chains, including Best Buy Canada and Future Shop, The Brick, Sears Canada, the Gap Inc. (which includes its stable of clothing stores the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy) will be incorporating the Black Friday theme to entice shoppers this weekend. In Ontario, Cadillac Fairview announced that nine of its malls will be extending their hours this Black Friday. Toronto's Eaton Centre mall, for example, will be opening at 6 a.m. 


"This is the biggest bargain hunting site in Canada and when people like that — they understand deals, they live and breathe deals —are expecting Black Friday to be big, we take it very seriously," said Ravitz."We think it's the voice of the consumer saying 'in Canada, we should see amazing Canadian deals,' if not there will be a lot of leakage to U.S. shopping."That cross-border shopping leakage is an obvious concern to Canadian retailers, who face increased cross-border challenges now that new duty-free exemptions came into effect earlier this year. 






Vincent Power, a spokesman for Sears Canada, said cross-border shopping began ramping up back in 2007, when the Canadian dollar reached parity with its U.S. counterpart (equivalent). "I think it woke up retailers to the fact that there was something special happening on that particular weekend," said Power, who noted that Sears Canada was one of the first of the big Canadian retailers to use the Black Friday term in its promotions. 




"So you have retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Canadian Tire, Indigo, Sears and so on that are offering significant discounts for the week and promoting it heavily when not long ago, it was nowhere in Canada." 



Canadian retailer sees big increase in sales. Power said Sears Canada increases its sales by double digits on Black Friday, compared to what they normally do on a regular day. 



"We know we're selling some stuff at low margin. We know that. But that's part of the entry fee for a retailer to play in Black Friday," he said.

The proliferation of inappropriate adult web sites has many parents really frightened. Children who never before had access to pornography or the acquaintance of insidious strangers out to harm them can now have both with the click of a mouse. Adults of young children are often very busy. They assume that as long as their children are being quiet, all is well. They MUST monitor all their children’s computer activity, because this is not so. Their children can be getting into life-threatening situations right in their own homes!
